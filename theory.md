In an impact test, a specially prepared notched specimen is fractured by a single blow from a heavy hammer. The energy required is the measure of resistance to impact. Impact load is produced by a swinging an impact weight W (hammer) from a height h. 

Release of the weight from the height h swings the weight through the arc of a circle, which strikes the specimen to fracture at the notch.
