- In a impact test a specially prepared notched specimen is fractured by a single blow from a heavy hammer and energy required being a measure of resistance to impact. Impact load is produced by a swinging of an impact weight W (hammer) from a height h. 

- Release of the weight from the height h swings the weight through the arc of a circle, which strikes the specimen to fracture at the notch.
