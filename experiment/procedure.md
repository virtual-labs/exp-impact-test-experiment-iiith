 **Procedure**

1. Measure the dimensions of the specimen. Also, measure the dimensions of the notch.
2. Raise the hammer and note down initial reading from the dial, which will be energy used to fracture the specimen.
3. Place the specimen for test and ensure that it is placed center with respect to hammer. Check the position of notch.
4. Release the hammer and note the final reading. Difference between the initial and final reading will give the actual energy required to fracture the Specimen.
5. Compute the energy of rupture of specimen.


**Virtual Procedure**
1. Start the experiment by clicking the play button.
2. Observe the impact caused by the moving hammer on the test specimen.
3. The test specimen breaks into two pieces and the loss of energy is calculated.
4. An observation table is provided with different trials. Mean energy for failure of specimen is calculated.
5. The experiment allows you to pause/play/restart the simulation..
