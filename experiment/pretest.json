                "a": "find out the absolute value of a material",
                "b": "to determine the tensile strength of a material",
                "c": "compare two specimens of similar composition and tensile strength",

                "c": "The impact test can be used to compare two specimens that have a similar composition and tensile strength. It has no absolute value. The test used to determine the tensile strength of a material is the tension test."

            "answers": {
                "a": "To determine ductility",
                "b": "To determine if the material has been subjected to heat treatment",
                "c": "To prevent material from corroding",
                "d": "To obtain absolute values"
            },
            "explanations": {
                "b": "The principal or main reason that the impact test is conducted upon a material is to ascertain if the material has undergone the required accurate heat treatment. The experiment gives no absolute value."
